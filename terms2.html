<center><h2 id="section-1">Earnings Disclaimer</h2></center>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">The following describes the Earnings Disclaimer for our http://www.aheadadvisors.com website which is owned and operated by Master Minds</h3>
<p class="lh-base">
We make every effort to ensure that we accurately represent these products and services and their potential for income. Earning and Income statements made by Master Minds and its customers are estimates of what we think you can possibly earn. There is no guarantee that you will make these levels of income and you accept the risk that the earnings and income statements differ by individual.</p>
<p class="lh-base">
As with any business, your results may vary, and will be based on your individual capacity, business experience, expertise, and level of desire. There are no guarantees concerning the level of success you may experience. The testimonials and examples used are exceptional results, which do not apply to the average purchaser, and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
Each individual’s success depends on his or her background, dedication, desire and motivation. There is no assurance that examples of past earnings can be duplicated in the future. We cannot guarantee your future results and/or success. There are some unknown risks in business and on the internet that we cannot foresee which can reduce results. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
We are not responsible for your actions. The use of our information, products and services should be based on your own due diligence and you agree that Master Minds is not liable for any success or failure of your business that is directly or indirectly related to the purchase and use of our information, products and services. </p>

<p class="lh-base">This website contains or may contain “forward looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of1933 and Section 21B of the Securities Exchange Act of1934. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be “forward looking statements.” </p>
<p class="lh-base">
Forward looking statements are based on expectations, estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements in this action may be identified through the use of words such as “expects”, “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” or statements indicating certain actions “may,” “could,” or “might” occur. </p>

<center>FTC Compliance</center>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
The following describes the Federal Trade Commission Compliance for our http://www.aheadadvisors.com website which is owned and operated by Master Minds.</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
We make every effort regarding any products or services we use, recommend, or otherwise make mention of at Master Minds. We strive to clearly differentiate between our own products or services versus those of third parties, to facilitate inquiries, support, and customer care. Likewise, just as we (and any other legitimate business) may profit from the sale of our own products or services, we may also profit from the sale of others’ products or services (like any retailer) at Master Minds. Additionally, wherever products or services may give rise to income generation, we endeavor to provide realistic and factual data, but highlight the fact that the variables impacting results are so numerous and uncontrollable that no guarantees are in any way made. It is our goal to embrace the guidelines and requirements of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the benefit of all, and with that in mind provide the following disclosures regarding compensation and disclaimer regarding earnings & income. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Note that material connections may not be made known at every single advertisement or affiliate link. Thus, to be safe, you should simply assume there is a material connection and that we may receive compensation in money or otherwise for anything you purchase as a result of visiting this website, and also that we may be paid merely by you clicking any link.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Amazon</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
One or more parties affiliated or associated with our Master Minds website in some way may be an Amazon affiliate. This means that links to products on Amazon.com, as well as reviews leading to purchases, can result in a commission being earned. Again, disclosure of this material connection and the potential for compensation may not be made at every single possible opportunity. To be safe, simply assume there is a material connection and potential for compensation at all times. While this does not imply skewed or unduly biased reviews, full disclosure calls for this warning.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Compensation  </h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
You should assume that we may be compensated for purchases of products or services mentioned on this Master Minds website that are not created, owned, licensed, or otherwise materially controlled by us. Stated differently, while most people obviously understand that individuals make a living by way of the profit that remains after the costs associated with providing their product or service are covered, at least theoretically there may be someone out there who does not understand that a third party can "affiliate" someone else's products or services and be compensated by the product or service creator/owner for helping spread the word about their offering. Just compare it to retailers. They seldom produce anything, but rather make their money connecting product and service creators with end users. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Admonition</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
Having said that, you cannot count on anyone looking after your interests but you. So, you ought to always do your own research into various offers and opportunities, to the extent that leaves you comfortable, doing your own due diligence prior to making any purchase of any product or service from this Master Minds website or any other. Here is a great set of guidelines for you to keep in mind:</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
First, just always operate from the position that any website proprietor, including us at Master Minds, will have a material connection to the product or service provider, and may be compensated as a result of your purchase, unless expressly stated otherwise. Aside from your purchases, note that even you actions could result in earnings for this website. For instance, there could be ads displayed on this Master Minds website that we are compensated for displaying whenever a website visitor clicks on them. 
  <p class="lh-base">
Second, to the extent that we have every interest in positively furthering our business relationship with you, we certainly desire to share only those offerings that we believe will benefit you. Just because we are not the founder or originator of the product or service, we are not going to withhold knowledge of this offering from you. If you can get some benefit from it, regardless of whether or not you've taken advantage of our own products and/or services, we want you to do well. Thus, we make a good faith effort to only present to you items that we either personally use, have actually tried, or else have faith in the reputation of the provider or concept. You can count on us making this determination based on all relevant and applicable information at the time of the recommendation. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Third, despite the fact that it would be counterproductive to mention products or services that you'll find disappointing or inferior, not only are people different, but it’s also possible for us to have a lapse in judgment. Thus, to be extra cautious, even if you believe in our good faith motives, you may as well go ahead and keep in mind that we could be at least partially influenced by the monetization factor of listing various products or services on our Master Minds website. Furthermore, in that vein, the reality is that there are sometimes other connections between parties that are not monetary, such as personal capital, goodwill, or otherwise, that could be an underlying undercurrent swaying the decision to promote a particular offering. Due to this hypothetical possibility, you should again simply nor rely solely on what we have to say, but rather just form your own independent opinion just to be safe. Finally, bear in mind that we might also receive free products or services, gifts, or review copies of items too. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Testimonials</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
Testimonials regarding the outcome or performance of using any product or service are provided to embellish your understanding of the offering. While great effort is made to ensure that they are factually honest, we at Master Minds are not liable for errors and omissions. Aside from human error, some information may be provided by third parties, such as customers or product/service providers. The best results are not uncommonly correlated with the best efforts, discipline, diligence, and so on, and thus the results depicted cannot, in any way, be construed as common, typical, expected, normal, or associated with the average user’s experience with any given product or service. Exceptional results may be depicted by our website as highlights, but you are responsible for understanding that atypical outcomes may not reflect your experience. Aside from market conditions, products and services change over time. Older products may lose effectiveness. Newer products may not have a reliable track record. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Where products or services might pertain to earning money, the same safeguards about use of testimonials apply. Additionally, note that any related income figures are highly specific to the individual or entity that produced those results, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to leverage the same, or similar, products or services to achieve comparable results. The results, though real, may be the result of the conflation of a number of favorable circumstances that would be difficult to replicate, and so you must proceed with the knowledge that your outcome can differ from any shared on our website.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Professional Consultation  </h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
Many products and services are designed to solve problems. Common problem areas include legal, financial, and medical. We are in no way purporting to counsel you on issues related law, finances, or health. If you require guidance in these arenas, you should consider securing your own counsel from lawyers, accountants, tax professionals, investment advisors, or medical professionals before taking any action. Nothing we may ever communicate at Master Minds, in print or spoken word, will ever be intended to constitute any such counsel, as we do not claim to be professionals in any of those disciplines. You assume all risk for actions taken, losses incurred, damages sustained, or other issues stemming from your use of any product or service in any way connected with or mentioned on this website. Indeed, such decision is solely your own, or else determined in conjunction with the professional guidance of the advisor of your choosing. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Use Of Products & Services</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
The following are facts you should be advised of if you intend to take advantage of any products or services: 
The price paid for products and services change over time. Even the prices of staples and basic commodities change, and there are many factors such as supply and demand, sales and other customer acquisition incentives, and more. Price, and value, can be quite relative. Technology, innovations, product improvements, market penetration, and numerous other factors all weigh in. It is impossible to define the “right” price for any product and service. Willing buyers and willing sellers determine price at any given time. You accept the fact that your purchase reflects your own attribution of value at the time of purchase, and that the price may increase or decrease in the future.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
The outcome you experience is dependent upon many factors. Aptitude and attitude go a long way towards success with products and services in virtually any niche, whether fitness or making money. Circumstances, experience, innate abilities, personality, education, time commitments, and perseverance are just a few factors. Given the smorgasbord of interrelated variables, there is no way to reasonably predict your specific outcome with any degree of reliability or certainty. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Income-Producing Products & Services  </h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
Income-producing products & services are likewise subject to the above cautions. In addition, however, there are additional factors we like to point out at Master Minds. Unlike weight loss products or self-help materials, income-producing methods are influenced by the overall health of the economy in which one operates. In times of liquidity, money flows freely and commerce is easier. In times of perceived scarcity, fear, recession, depression, or otherwise, commerce is stymied. Results can be influenced by market sentiment, just as the stock market indices around the world are swayed heavily on news.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Income-producing products & services purchased should be viewed as just that – purchases. Though they can be investments in one’s business, it is not unreasonable to expect that there may not be an express return on that investment, per se. Often, business success is the convergence of a number of factors, methods, strategies, and so on. It can be hard to peg success to one method or machination. This does not necessarily undermine value of any given product or service, as it can have an additive effect. Or, it may have no effect. Since it can be difficult to tell, you should operate on the assumption that your outcome could be zero. We make no guarantees and you should only risk what you can afford to lose on any purchases on or through Master Minds.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Earning & Income  </h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
In light of all of the factors above, impinging on the very nature of income-producing products and services, there is no way to guarantee results of any kind whatsoever. Accordingly, we affirmatively declare that we make no guarantees as to your earnings & income of any kind, at any time. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
As with any business endeavor or investment, past performance is no guarantee or predictor of future performance. Any testimonials or other representations of results are for illustrative purposes only and, though every effort is made to ensure they’re factually honest, they are not intended to imply or insinuate what is likely to happen with you. Your reliance on them as such is not advised.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
It should be noted that “earnings & income” is so phrased with specific intent. While income may typify the earnings most either seek or are accustomed to, earnings can come in non-monetary forms. These include some forms that are abstract or intangible, and thus not even readily converted to currency or a common medium of exchange. Thus, note that all manner of compensation, including earnings of a non-income yet nevertheless beneficial form, are covered by these provisions.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Affiliates & Other Third Parties</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
It should also be noted that we only have control over, and thus only accept responsibility for, the content of this Master Minds website authored by us. Any representations made by others should be considered prima facie unauthorized. You may also read, hear, or otherwise come into contact with commentary about any of our products & services or offerings, and should assume those have likewise not been authorized.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
While information, in any form, can arise, at any time, regarding our products & services, there may be times when this results from an affiliate relationship. In other words, we may permit our products & services to be marketed through other individuals, businesses, websites, and otherwise, just as providers of goods and services use retailers and other vendors to make available what they offer. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
You should not construe a third-party offer as an endorsement by that third party of any product or service. You should, more conservatively, view it as an offer to buy something. Likewise, as alluded to previously, note that we cannot fully control all marketing practices by all parties. With the use of “mirror” sites, indirect or unauthorized affiliates, “tiered” affiliate structures, and so on, policing the world wide web with any modicum of thoroughness is unlikely. We make reasonable efforts to ensure our affiliates comply with our policies and represent our products & services consistent with our guidelines. However, at Master Minds we cannot always guarantee they will do so. You are always free to report concerns or abuses via our Contact information.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Customer Care  </h3>

  <p class="lh-base">Last, but not least, please note that our role in briefing you on products and services other than our own is simply as a "matchmaker." We do not provide any support or customer service for those items and you should always contact the owner or provider of those products or services to have any and all questions answered to your satisfaction before purchasing.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
CHANGE NOTICE:</h3>  <p class="lh-base"> As with any of our administrative and legal notice pages, the contents of this page can and will change over time. Accordingly, this page could read differently as of your very next visit. These changes are necessitated, and carried out by Master Minds, in order to protect you and our Master Minds website.

This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of this website and to compile statistical reports on website activity. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
We will never (and will not allow any third party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect any Personally Identifiable Information of visitors to our site. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither we nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

Other Collection of Personal Information </h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Other information may be collected as well, which is rather typical of most websites. For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally known. Likewise, your duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be tracked. Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you are using to access our website has. Similarly, the type of web browser is often noted. Again, this is common data collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Cookies are another common internet practice. Cookies are a key means of improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our website. Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the content and experience to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on. You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so choose. Please understand that refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some aspects useless to you. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it. For instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise. Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on. Refusing to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve requested. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
A prime example of limited access to our website is where content may be protected by a username and password. Whether a username and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information related to or connected with you. This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for. Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account data. Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Website Cookies</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may not function correctly and could even become inaccessible.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
What Data We Collect About You</h3>
   <p class="lh-base">
Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymised data.</p>
 
We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Handling of Personal Information </h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional. As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment. That “private” information is now “public,” and we have no control over that. In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business. We can use this internally to better serve you. Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.” However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole. This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base. Further, we may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
While we are staunch privacy advocates, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals. Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our website. Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website. In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law. </p>
  <p class="lh-base">
On the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect our own interests. For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Disclosures of your personal data.</h3>
   <p class="lh-base">
We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the section above titled "Lawful basis and purposes for processing personal data"</p>

<ul class="my-4">		    
<li class="mb-3 lh-base">Service providers who provide IT and system administration services. </li>
<li class="mb-3 lh-base">Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers.</li>
<li class="mb-3 lh-base"> Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
<li class="mb-3 lh-base"> Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. </li> 
</ul>
			    
			    
			    <p class="lh-base">
We only permit such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Marketing communications</h3>
   <p class="lh-base">
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have:
(a) requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us; or
(b) if you provided us with your details and ticked the box at the point of entry of your details for us to send you marketing communications; and
(c) in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>
   <p class="lh-base">
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you OR by emailing us at support@aheadadvisors.com at any time, or by using the contact form on this page.</p>
   <p class="lh-base">
Where you opt out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Change of purpose  </h3>
   <p class="lh-base">
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another purpose and that purpose is compatible with the original purpose. </p>
   <p class="lh-base">
If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal ground of processing.</p>
   <p class="lh-base">
We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Third party service providers outside of the European Economic Area.</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
   <p class="lh-base">
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>


 <ul class="my-4">			    
<li class="mb-3 lh-base">We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li> 
<li class="mb-3 lh-base"> Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li> 
<li class="mb-3 lh-base"> Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
Please email us at support@aheadadvisors.com if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</li> 
 </ul>
			    
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Data Security</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
We have in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal data and to prevent it from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. Additionally, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
  <p class="lh-base">
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
 <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Retention of Data</h3>
  <p class="lh-base">
We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
We are legally required to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
We reserve the right to anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
 
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Comments Policy </h3>
<p class="lh-base">
As you know, Web 2.0 is all about the conversation. But without a few simple ground rules, that conversation can turn into a shouting match that discourages others from entering into the fray. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
So here is Master Minds comments policy. By posting on my blog, you agree to the following:</p>
<p class="lh-base">
You may comment without registering. You can log-in via Disqus, OpenID, Twitter, Facebook—or not at all. It’s up to you. You may post anonymously. I don’t recommend this, but you may do so if you wish. I may change this rule if it is abused. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
You may post follow-up questions. If you have a question, chances are you are not alone. Others are likely thinking similarly. Therefore, I would rather receive your comments on Master Minds than via email. It is a better use of my time to address everyone at once rather than answer several similar emails. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
You may disagree with me. I welcome debate. However, I ask that if you disagree with me—or anyone else, for that matter—do so in a way that is respectful. In my opinion, there is way too much shouting in the public square to tolerate it here. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
Master Minds reserves the right to delete your comments. This is my blog. I don’t have an obligation to publish your comments. The First Amendment gives you the right to express your opinions on your blog not mine. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
Specifically, I will delete your comments if you post something that is, in my sole opinion, (a)snarky; (b) off-topic; (c) libelous, defamatory, abusive, harassing, threatening, profane, pornographic, offensive, false, misleading, or which otherwise violates or encourages others to violate my sense of decorum and civility or any law, including intellectual property laws; or (d) “spam,” i.e., an attempt to advertise, solicit, or otherwise promote goods and services. You may, however, post a link to your site or your most recent blog post. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
You retain ownership of your comments. I do not own them and I expressly disclaim any and all liability that may result from them. By commenting on my site, you agree that you retain all ownership rights in what you post here and that you will relieve me from any and all liability that may result from those postings. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
You grant Master Minds a license to post your comments. This license is worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free. You grant me the right to store, use, transmit, display, publish, reproduce, and distribute your comments in any format, including but not limited to a blog, in a book, a video, or presentation. </p>
<p class="lh-base">
In short, my goal is to host interesting conversations with caring, honest, and respectful people. I believe this simple comments policy will facilitate this. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Your Legal Rights</h3>

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:

<ul class="my-4">			    
<li class="mb-3 lh-base">Request access to your personal data.</li>
<li class="mb-3 lh-base">Request correction of your personal data.</li>
<li class="mb-3 lh-base"> Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
<li class="mb-3 lh-base"> Object to processing of your personal data.</li>

<p class="lh-base">
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at support@aheadadvisors.com.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
 <p class="lh-base">
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. On occasion it may take us longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. </p>

<center>Social Media Disclaimer</center>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
The following describes the Social Media Disclosure for our Master Minds website.
Social Media Issue</h3>

<p class="lh-base">We live in an interesting time when privacy rights are championed alongside an unprecedented voluntary willingness of people to share their most intimate and superfluous life details with the world, even in places such as our Master Minds website. While apparently benign on the surface, the dangers of unrestrained public disclosure of sensitive information is beginning to surface. </p>

<p class="lh-base">Key social media players are being sued for unauthorized or abusive use/misuse of personal information. Failure to protect and warn are likely going to be focal factors. Lawsuits are filed seeking damages for statements held to be responsible for people's death or suicide. Bloggers presuming to operate under an unfettered freedom of speech or greater latitude offered to members of the press are losing civil cases for defamation, slander, libel, and so on. </p>

<p class="lh-base">As social media rapidly advances to allow more technologically sophisticated and easy dissemination, the simultaneous fallout of revelation without boundaries is mounting. Thus, a sober approach to the benefits of social media, while sidestepping the perils of imprudent disclosure, can facilitate an enjoyable online experience, without the consequences of excess, in settings such as our own Master Minds website. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Presence/Scope of Social Media </h3>

<p class="lh-base">You should assume that social media is in use on our Master Minds website. A simple click of a button to endorse a person, product, or service is building a cumulative profile about you, which you should always assume can be discovered by others. Attempting to share a website with someone, whether by direct press of a button or else by email forwarding facilitated on a website, you should assume that this may not stop with the intended recipient, and that this can generate information about you that could be seen by a veritable infinite number of people. Such a domino effect could initiate right here on our Master Minds website. </p>

<p class="lh-base">Something as simple as a blog comment provides the opportunity for knee-jerk reactions that can become public and may not truly represent a position (at least in strength or severity) that you might hold after a period of more reasoned contemplation. You should also note that the ease of accessing one site through the login credentials of another, or the use of a global login for access to multiple sites can accumulate a dossier on you and your online behavior that may reveal more information to unintended parties than you might realize or want. Any or all of these features could exist on our Master Minds website at one time or another.</p>

<p class="lh-base">These few examples illustrate some possible ways that social media can exist, though it is not an exhaustive list and new technologies will render this list outdated quickly. The objective is to realize the reach of social media, its widespread presence on websites in various forms (including this website), and develop a responsible approach to using it. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Protecting Others </h3>

<p class="lh-base">You should recognize the fact that divulgences made in and on social media platforms on this website and others are rarely constrained just to you. Disclosures are commonly made about group matters that necessarily affect and impact other people. Other disclosures are expressly about third parties, sometimes with little discretion. What can appear funny in one moment can be tragic in the next. And a subtle "public" retaliation can have lifetime repercussions. </p>

<p class="lh-base">Ideal use of social media on our website would confine your disclosures primarily to matters pertaining to you, not others. If in doubt, it's best to err on the side of non-disclosure. It's doubtful the disclosure is so meaningful that it cannot be offset by the precaution of acting to protect the best interests of someone who is involuntarily being exposed by your decision to disclose something on our Master Minds website (or another).</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Protecting Yourself </h3>

<p class="lh-base">You should likewise pause to consider the long-term effects of a split-second decision to publicly share private information about yourself on our Master Minds website. Opinions, likes, dislikes, preferences, and otherwise can change. Openly divulging perspectives that you hold today, may conflict with your developing views into the futures. Yet, the "new you" will always stand juxtaposed against the prior declarations you made that are now concretized as part of your public profile. While the contents of your breakfast may hold little long-term impact, other data likewise readily shared can have consequences that could conceivably impact your ability to obtain certain employment or hinder other life experiences and ambitions. </p>

<p class="lh-base">As with sharing information about other people, extreme caution should be used before revealing information about yourself. If in doubt, it's likely best not to do it. The short term gain, if any, could readily be outweighed by later consequences. Finally, you should note that we are not responsible for removing content once shared, and we may not be able to do so. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Restrictions on Use of Social Media Data </h3>

<p class="lh-base">You, as a visitor to our Master Minds website, are not permitted to "mine" social media or other platforms contained herein for personal information related to others. Even where people have publicly displayed data, you should not construe that as though you have the liberty to capture, reproduce, or reuse that information. Any use of social media or related platforms on our website are for interactive use only, relevant only during the website visit. </p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Accuracy of Social Media Data</h3>

<p class="lh-base">As any social media platform is built on user-generated content, you should consider this fact in seeking to determine the authenticity of anything you read. We are not responsible for verifying any user-generated content for accuracy. A best practices policy would be to view all such content as strictly opinion, not fact.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">
Potential Issues of Liability</h3>

<p class="lh-base">You should also be mindful of the fact that your words could trigger liability for harm caused to others. While you have the right to free speech, you do not have the right to damage other people. Under basic principles of tort law, you are always responsible, personally, for situations where either:</p>

<p class="lh-base">1. you were required to act, but did not (i.e. - some "duty of care")</p>

<p class="lh-base">2. your were required to refrain from acting, but did not (i.e. - slander, defamation, etc.)
<p class="lh-base">These "sins of omission and commission" could cause problems for you, irrespective of whether you assert you are conducting business under the guise of one or more business entities. Illegal and unethical conduct, when done in the name of a corporation or LLC, is still illegal and unethical conduct. As it is rarely part of a business plan to engage in illegal and unethical conduct, you are doubtfully operating in any official capacity, but rather, perhaps, leveraging that capacity to effectuate personal wrongdoing. You should consult a licensed attorney if you wish legal advice as to the (potential) ramification of your situation or legal problems stemming from this website or another.</p>
<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">

You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by other users of our website will be at your own risk.
Our Master Minds website does not necessarily screen communications in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring material posted by users of our website. If observed by our website and/or notified by a user of communications which allegedly do not conform to this agreement, our website may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of the communication.

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Social Media Warning (Divulgence of Personal & Private Information) </h3>

<p class="lh-base">Social media has provided a platform for internet users to disclose much personal information about themselves, in a way that seems innocuous, if not proper and expected. However, more than a few folks have already lived to regret personal information that was shared either by them or others. This has long been true of simple email. It is exponentially true of social websites and applications for social media on any other website, including this one. You are cautioned against carelessly disclosing information. </p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">3. Indemnification.</h3>

<p class="lh-base">You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our Master Minds website, its members, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third party information providers to our website from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any use of our website or violation of this Agreement (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing our website.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">4. Third Party Rights.</h3>

<p class="lh-base">The provisions of paragraphs 2 (Use of the Service), and 3 (Indemnification) are for the benefit of our website and its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and any third party information providers to the Service. Each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those provisions directly against you on its/their own behalf. </p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">5.Term; Termination.</h3>

<p class="lh-base">We reserve the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use and to take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any data necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profile, email addresses, usage history, IP addresses and traffic data.</p>

<p class="lh-base">This Agreement, in whole or in part, may be terminated by Master Minds without notice at any time for any reason. The provisions of paragraphs 1 (Copyright, Licenses and Idea Submissions), 2 (Use of the Service), 3 (Indemnification), 4 (Third Party Rights), 6 (Hiring an Attorney / No Attorney-Client Relationship), and 7 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">6. Hiring an Investment Advisor, Attorney, or Medical or Other Professional / No Attorney-Client Relationship or Fiduciary Capacity.  </h3>

<p class="lh-base">Choosing a lawyer, doctor, or investment advisor is a serious matter and should NOT be based solely on data contained on our website or in advertisements. 
The law is constantly changing and the data may not be complete or accurate depending on your particular legal issue. Each legal issue depends on its individual facts and different jurisdictions have different laws and regulations. This is why you should seriously consider hiring licensed, professional counsel in your jurisdiction.
Medical issues are complex, and can often stem from both organic and psychological factors. Never should a website be used as a source of diagnosing or treating medical problems.</p>

<p class="lh-base">Financial matters are highly individualistic. Risk tolerance is just one factor to consider before making any investments or financial decisions. For these, and other, reasons, you should look to the guidance of a trained professional, not a website. 

You may send us email, but in no instance will this communication in any way be construed as initiating an attorney-client relationship, or other professional relationship, and so the contact should not include confidential or sensitive data because your communication will not be treated as privileged or confidential. </p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">7.Miscellaneous.</h3>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Disputes</h3>

<p class="lh-base">Any cause of action by you with respect to our Master Minds website must be instituted within one (1) year after the cause of action arose or be forever waived and barred. All actions shall be subject to the limitations set forth in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use. Any legal claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use or our website, excluding intellectual property right infringement and other claims by us, shall be settled confidentially through mandatory binding arbitration per the American Arbitration Association commercial arbitration rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in California. Each party shall bear one half of the arbitration fees and costs incurred, and each party shall bear its own lawyer fees. All claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. </p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Modification</h3>

<p class="lh-base">Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor industry trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Assignability</h3>

<p class="lh-base">Our website may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you. </p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Contra Preferentum</h3>

<p class="lh-base">The language in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party (i.e. – “contra preferentum”) shall not apply in interpreting these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, as the Agreement shall be construed as having been co-authored by the parties.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Severability</h3>

<p class="lh-base">Should any part of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed as much as possible consistent with applicable law and severability shall apply to the remaining portions, so that they remain in full force and effect. </p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">This Agreement Prevails </h3>

<p class="lh-base">To the extent that anything in or associated with our website is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall take precedence. </p>

<p class="lh-base">Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall not be deemed a waiver of the provision nor of the right to enforce the provision. 
Our rights under these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall survive any termination of this agreement.</p>

<h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to Master Minds. </h3>
